We started this project after realizing that we were being recruited to perform the same engineering feat over and over for different companies.  A well engineered cloud starting point is not diffucult nor should it be.  We have published what we believe to be a well engineered, secure on day one, simple cloud structure starting with Google Cloud and then covering AWS and Azure.  Using the documentation from the clouds themselves, along with the tooling best practices, we have built a simple starting point to ensure a secure and simple cloud platform to build on top of.
